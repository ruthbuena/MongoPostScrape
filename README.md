Mongo Post Scrape

Mongo Post Scrape is a web scraping application that scrapes for articles on The New York Times using Node, Handlebars, MongoDB, Cheerio and Mongoose.

The main tools used for scraping include Mongoose and Cheerio.  Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model application data when using MongoDB.  Cheerio is a fast and efficient tool for parsing, manipulating and rendering with a DOM model.  Because of this, Cheerio is commonly used for scraping data from the web.
